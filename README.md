Maze Project for AI class at Rutgers 
Worked on by Vishal Patel and Nilay Naik

#Preliminaries

##Maze Generator
mazeGenerator will provide the logic to generate a grid
based on dimension input and an obstacle density
(probability of a square being an obstacle or not).

In addition, mazeGenerator provides logic to populate the 
maze with fire, given a flammability rate.

#Our Strategy

#Maze Visualization
Provides Logic for visualizing the grid.
This part is optional for running the program
and the user decides if they want to see the 
visualization or not.
