# will increment blocking factor from 0.05 to 1 in steps of 0.05, then it will generate a maze of dim 1000
    # then it will run the preliminary dfs implementation
    # this is repeated 100 times for every new matrix to get a solid probability
    # the results are outputted in an array of tuples in the form [(blockingFactor,probSuccess),...]
    # these results will make the graph easy to plot and we will have a solid number of points of data

#for now this is just a test with maze dim of 5x5 and sample size of 1000
result = dfsProbabilityHelper(500,1000)
# now performing matplotlib logic to generate the graph
